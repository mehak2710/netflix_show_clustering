# 🎬 Netflix Show Clustering

This mini-project performs clustering on a small custom Netflix dataset based on show type, genre, and duration. Using K-Means and PCA, we group similar shows and visualize the clusters for better understanding of content distribution.

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Manually curated mini Netflix dataset
- 🧹 Basic preprocessing (duration & genre extraction)
- 🔍 One-Hot Encoding of categorical variables
- 🤖 K-Means Clustering to group similar shows
- 📊 PCA for dimensionality reduction & visualization
- 📝 Output CSV with assigned cluster labels

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python - Core programming language.
- pandas - Data manipulation and processing.
- Scikit-learn - For KMeans Clustering, OneHotEncoder and PCA
- Matplotlib - Visualizing clusters with scatter plots.
- Jupyter Notebook - Interactive documentation and execution.
