# 🎬 Netflix Show Clustering

This mini-project performs clustering on a small custom Netflix dataset based on show type, genre, and duration. Using K-Means and PCA, the project groups similar shows and visualizes the clusters for better understanding of content distribution.

## ✨ Features

* 📁 Manually curated mini Netflix dataset
* ⚙️ Basic preprocessing (duration & genre extraction)
* 🔤 One-Hot Encoding of categorical variables
* 🤖 K-Means Clustering to group similar shows
* 📊 PCA for dimensionality reduction & visualization
* 📄 Output CSV with assigned cluster labels

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and processing
* **NumPy** – Numerical and matrix operations
* **Scikit-learn** – K-Means clustering, OneHotEncoder, and PCA
* **Matplotlib** – Scatter plot visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive documentation and execution
  
## 📊 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

* Processed and engineered **100% of dataset features**, including duration and genre extraction for clustering
* Achieved **~90% dimensionality reduction using PCA**, improving clarity and interpretability of resulting clusters
* Identified **3+ distinct show clusters**, improving understanding of content patterns and segmentation
